Exercise 2 Make a side-by-side boxplot of habit and weight. What does the plot highlight
about the relationship between these two variables?
"
boxplot(nc$habit, nc$weight, horizontal=T)
with(nc, plot(weight ~ habit))
# babies of smokers weigh less, on average. lots of outliers in the "nonsmoker" category
smoker = subset(nc, habit=="smoker")
nonsmoker = subset(nc, habit=="nonsmoker")
t.test(smoker$weight, nonsmoker$weight)

# another way to compare, the by function
by(nc$weight, nc$habit, mean)

"
Exercise 3 Check if the conditions necessary for inference are satisÔ¨Åed. Note that you will
need to obtain sample sizes to check the conditions. You can compute the group size using the
same by command above but replacing mean with length.
"
by(nc$weight, nc$habit, length)
hist(smoker$weight)
hist(nonsmoker$weight)
# left skew in both but fairly normal. also check via quantile plots:
qqnorm(smoker$weight)
qqline(smoker$weight)
qqnorm(nonsmoker$weight)
qqline(nonsmoker$weight)

"
Exercise 4 Write the hypotheses for testing if the average weights of babies born to smoking
and non-smoking mothers are different.
"
# null: There is no difference in the average weights of babies born to smoking mothers and babies born to non-smoking mothers.
# hypothesis: On average, babies born to smoking mothers weigh less than babies born to non-smoking mothers.

# run "inference" function that came with the data set
inference(y = nc$weight, x = nc$habit, est = "mean", type = "ht", null = 0,
          alternative = "twosided", method = "theoretical")
